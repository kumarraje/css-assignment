Absolute Positioning:
With absolute positioning, elements are positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor.
If there's no positioned ancestor, elements are positioned relative to the initial containing block, typically the viewport or the browser window.
When an element is absolutely positioned, it is taken out of the normal document flow. 
This means other elements on the page may ignore the space that the absolutely positioned element would have taken up.
Absolute positioning allows for precise placement of elements, as their position is specified in relation to a known ancestor or the viewport.

Relative Positioning:
With relative positioning, elements are shifted from their normal position on the page, but they still occupy space in the document flow.
The relative positioning offsets an element from its normal position on the page, but the space it would have occupied remains reserved in the document flow. 
This means other elements still interact with it as if it were in its original position.
Relative positioning is often used when you want to move an element relative to its normal position without affecting the layout of other elements on the page.
