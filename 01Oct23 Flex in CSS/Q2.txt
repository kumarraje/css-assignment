justify-content:
This property defines how the browser distributes space between and around content items along the main axis of the flex container. 
It controls the alignment of flex items when they do not use all available space on the main axis.

align-items:
This property determines how flex items are aligned within the flex container along the cross axis. It specifies the default alignment for items inside the flex container.

gap:
The gap property is used to define the space between flex items in both directions, along the main axis and the cross axis. 
It's often applied to the flex container itself. It simplifies spacing and creates consistent gaps between items without needing to apply margins to individual items.

flex-direction:
This property sets the direction of the main axis in the flex container. It determines whether the flex items are laid out in a row or a column, 
as well as the direction in which they flow.

flex-wrap:
This property specifies whether flex items are forced onto a single line or can wrap onto multiple lines within the flex container. It controls whether the flex container allows its items to wrap if there's not enough space on a single line.
These properties are crucial for controlling the layout and behavior of flex containers and their items, allowing developers to create flexible and responsive designs using Flexbox.
