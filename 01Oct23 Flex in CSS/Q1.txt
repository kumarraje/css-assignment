1.Main Purpose:
Flexbox: Primarily designed for one-dimensional layouts, either in a row or a column.
Grid: Designed for two-dimensional layouts, offering both rows and columns simultaneously.

2.Layout Model:
Flexbox: Works with a flex container and flex items. It's best for arranging items within a container in a single direction, either horizontally or vertically.
Grid: Works with both rows and columns simultaneously, allowing precise placement of items within a grid structure.

3.Alignment:
Flexbox: Provides powerful alignment options along the main axis and the cross axis, allowing you to align items and distribute space within a single row or column.
Grid: Also offers alignment options but on both row and column axes independently, providing more control over item placement within the grid.

4.Responsive Design:
Flexbox: Ideal for handling small-scale layouts or components within a larger layout. It's commonly used for responsive designs at a component level.
Grid: Suited for larger-scale layouts or entire page structures. It's often used to create responsive designs at a broader level, controlling the layout of entire sections of a webpage.

5.Nested Layouts:
Flexbox: Works well for nesting within other flex containers, allowing for complex layouts within a single direction.
Grid: Works efficiently for nested grids within other grid containers, enabling intricate two-dimensional layouts.

6.When to Choose:
Flexbox: Use it when dealing with layouts primarily in one dimension, like navigation menus, sidebars, or vertically stacking items.
Grid: Choose it for layouts requiring precise control over both rows and columns, such as overall page structures, complex forms, or image galleries.
